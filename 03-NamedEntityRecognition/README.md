# Named Entity Recognition

## Work Request

You have to implement a model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER), and more details are shown in [tutorial](./Tutorial.pdf).

If you have difficulties on starting from scratch, we present a [code template](./code_template.py) for you. But you are encouraged not to use it.

[Grading criteria](./Grading-Criteria.png) is also presented.

## My Work

Run `train.py` to train a model.

Run `main.py` to do inference.

[Report](./report.pdf) for this assignment.
